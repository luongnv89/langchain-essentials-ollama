# ðŸ”— LangChain Essentials Python


## ðŸš€ Setup 

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you're using Python 3.11 - 3.13.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager or [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- OpenAI API key
- Node.js and npx (required for MCP server in notebook 3):
```bash
# Install Node.js (includes npx)
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew install node

# On Ubuntu/Debian:
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify installation:
node --version
npx --version
```

### Installation

Download the course repository

```bash
# Clone the repo, cd to 'python' directory
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/lca-langchainV1-essentials.git
cd ./lca-langchainV1-essentials/python
```

Make a copy of example.env

```bash
# Create .env file
cp example.env .env
```

Insert API keys directly into .env file, OpenAI (required) and [LangSmith](#getting-started-with-langsmith) (optional)

```bash
# Add OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# The course is written with OpenAI models, but you can choose others if you prefer. 
# Be sure to add the key and modify the code to call your preferred model
#ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here_if_you_prefer

# Optional API key for LangSmith tracing
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=langgraph-py-essentials
# If you are on the EU instance:
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com

```

Make a virtual environment and install dependancies
```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependancies
uv sync
```

Run notebooks

```bash
# Run Jupyter notebooks directly with uv
uv run jupyter lab

# Or activate the virtual environment if preferred
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
jupyter lab
```

Optional: Setup [LangSmith Studio](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/studio)

```bash
# copy the .env file you created above to the studio directory
cp .env ./studio/.

#to run
langgraph dev
```

### Getting Started with LangSmith

- Create a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) account
- Create a LangSmith API key

# ðŸ“š Lessons
This repository contains nine short notebooks that serve as brief introductions to many of the most-used features in LangChain, starting with the new **Create Agent**.

---

### `L1_fast_agent.ipynb` - ðŸ¤– Create Agent ðŸ¤–
- In this notebook, you will use LangChainâ€™s `create_agent` to build an SQL agent in just a few lines of code.  
- It demonstrates how quick and easy it is to build a powerful agent. You can easily take this agent and apply it to your own project. 
- You will also use **LangSmith Studio**, a handy visual debugger to run, host, and explore agents.

---

### `L2-7.ipynb` - ðŸ§± Building Blocks ðŸ§±
In Lessons 2â€“7, you will learn how to use some of the fundamental building blocks in LangChain. These lessons explain and complement `create_agent`, and youâ€™ll find them useful when creating your own agents. Each lesson is concise and focused.

- **L2_messages.ipynb**: Learn how messages convey information between agent components.  
- **L3_streaming.ipynb**: Learn how to reduce user-perceived latency using streaming.  
- **L4_tools.ipynb**: Learn basic tool use to enhance your model with custom or prebuilt tools.  
- **L5_tools_with_mcp.ipynb**: Learn to use the LangChain MCP adapter to access the world of MCP tools.  
- **L6_memory.ipynb**: Learn how to give your agent the ability to maintain state between invocations.  
- **L7_structuredOutput.ipynb**: Learn how to produce structured output from your agent.  

---

### `L8-9.ipynb` - ðŸª› Customize Your Agent ðŸ¤–
Lessons 2â€“7 covered out-of-the-box features. However, `create_agent` also supports both prebuilt and user-defined customization through **Middleware**. This section describes middleware and includes two lessons highlighting specific use cases.

- **L8_dynamic.ipynb**: Learn how to dynamically modify the agentâ€™s system prompt to react to changing contexts.  
- **L9_HITL.ipynb**: Learn how to use Interrupts to enable Human-in-the-Loop interactions.
